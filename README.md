- 👋 Hi, I’m @shoetowngirl
- 👀 I’m interested in health data, primarily, but also fascinated by cool ways to visualise information
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I am struggling to get to grips with all this Data Science malarky
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me get my head around it!
- 📫 How to reach me harriet.roach1@nhs.net
- 😄 Pronouns: My handle should give you a clue ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have absolutely no background in numbers, maths or stats. I did a politics and language degree so everything I know, I have figured out for myself!
